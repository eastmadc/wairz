#   - ``suppress_check_ids``: set of check IDs whose findings are suppressed

#     and nothing else that's dangerous/signature)
#   - ``reduce_confidence``: if True and the finding is not fully suppressed,
#     reduce the confidence to "low" instead (softer suppression)
#
# The matching logic is: for a given APK, collect all its requested
# permissions.  For each allowlist entry, if the APK's "interesting"
# permissions (dangerous + signature) are a subset of the entry's permission
# set, all findings whose check_id is in ``suppress_check_ids`` are

        """Run manifest-level security checks on an APK.

        Each check assigns a **static base severity** matching MobSF's
        classification.  When the APK is in a privileged firmware
        location (``/system/priv-app/``) or is signed with the platform
        key, **all findings are automatically bumped +1 severity level**
        (info→low→medium→high→critical) to reflect the wider blast
        radius of privileged system components.

        **Severity reduction for platform-signed system components:**
        After the bump, if the APK is platform-signed AND has
        signatureOrSystem-level protection (detected via declared
        permissions, requested platform-signature permissions, or
        system shared UID), findings for *expected system behaviour*
        checks are automatically **reduced by 1 severity level**.
        This prevents noisy false-positive-grade findings on legitimate
        OEM/AOSP system apps.  See ``_PLATFORM_SIGNED_REDUCIBLE_CHECKS``
        for the eligible check IDs.

        **Permission-combination allowlisting:**
        Before firmware-context adjustments, known-safe permission
        combinations (e.g., INTERNET + ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE) are checked
        against the APK's requested permissions.  Findings matching
        ``suppress_check_ids`` for applicable safe groups are suppressed
        entirely; other findings have their confidence reduced to "low".
        See ``_SAFE_PERMISSION_GROUPS`` for the full allowlist.

        Returns a dict with ``package``, ``findings`` (list of finding
        dicts), ``summary`` counts by severity, ``total_findings``,
        ``suppressed_findings``, ``suppressed_count``, ``suppression_reasons``,
        ``severity_bumped`` (bool), ``severity_reduced`` (bool), and
        ``reduced_check_ids`` (list of check IDs that were reduced).

        ----------
        apk_path:
            Absolute path to the APK file.
        is_priv_app:
            Whether the APK resides in a ``/system/priv-app/`` directory.
            Triggers automatic +1 severity bump on all findings.
        is_platform_signed:
            Whether the APK is signed with the platform key.  Triggers
            automatic +1 severity bump on all findings.  Also triggers
            severity reduction for eligible checks if the APK has
            signatureOrSystem protection.
