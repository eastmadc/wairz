> **Last updated:** 2026-05-21 (SBOM/vuln-scan regression investigation Session 1 — Wave-1 + Wave-2 deep research methodology applied to operator-reported "SBOM + vuln-scan appear to have regressed" symptom. 5 Wave-1 single-axis scouts + 3 Wave-2 critique scouts surfaced a multi-defect cascade. W2-γ Rule #28 yardstick determined MULTI-SESSION-RECOMMENDED (~1,731 net LOC / 17 commits projected against rate-limit-2026-05-18 baseline). Session 1 ships 7 production commits + 1 mock follow-up: FK unblock + frontend rebuild + bare_metal walker registration + walker fan-out un-gating (Rule #25 single-slice atomic w/ §SC5-NEW-SBOM-θ semaphore guard) + 2 orphan reapers (upload_stage + bare_metal_audit) + asyncio.create_task GC hardening. ~969 net LOC / 25 new META-CANARY tests / live runtime fix proof (Fix #5 reaper LIVE-FIRED on TMS320 row). Session 2 queued: SBOM /generate Rule #33 sync→202+polling conversion + grype force_rescan + post_process unpack gate + walker `*_walk_status` reaper sweep. Prior 2026-05-20 afternoon: ICS protocol catalog Session 1 — 3 commits `0dabbd6..1d0d0a9` ship the foundation for Rule #52's third worked-example surface (schema + closed Literals + catalog + resolver + 1 production YAML + 114 tests; W2-γ determined MULTI-SESSION-RECOMMENDED — Session 2 walker + MCP + plugins + Rule #52 Rule-of-Three promotion queued). Prior 2026-05-20 morning: P3.x `substring_in_head` signal kind closing P3.2 Rec #2 (windows_installer_iso + iso_9660 bridge cleanup). Prior 2026-05-19: file-format YAML registry Phase 3.2 + Phase 3.3.a (15 commits) + Rule #52 Rule-of-One → Rule-of-Two promotion.

## 2. Open — HIGH severity (operator-visibility + forensic-correctness)

| ID | Severity | Source | Item | Effort | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| `sbom-regr-session2:Fix-1` | HIGH | 2026-05-21 SBOM/vuln-scan regression Wave-2 γ | SBOM `/generate` Rule #33 sync→202+polling conversion + `sbom_status` state machine + alembic migration + Pydantic Literal + DB CHECK + frontend polling refactor + orphan reaper + Rule #46 META-CANARY trio | ~420 LOC across 4 Rule #25 commits + 1 Rule #48 Shape-1 cross-stack alignment | Largest deferred item from 2026-05-21 investigation; W2-γ scoped as Session 2's dominant work. Mirror `8f54a24`/`3d2454b` pattern. W2-β §SC5-NEW-SBOM-α/β/γ/ν all apply — `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'idle'` migration from start; no asyncio.gather on shared session; dual generate+scan polling considerations; force_rescan precedence in 409 dedup. |
| `sbom-regr-session2:Fix-6` | HIGH | 2026-05-21 SBOM/vuln-scan regression Wave-1 Scout A | `scan_with_grype` honors `force_rescan` — DELETE-before-INSERT in a single transaction (W2-β §SC5-NEW-SBOM-μ data-loss guard) | ~105 LOC / 1 commit | Without this, repeated rescans DOUBLE `sbom_vulnerabilities` row count. Fix wraps DELETE+INSERT in the caller's session so a Grype subprocess failure rolls back the DELETE alongside the partial INSERT. |
| `sbom-regr-session2:Fix-9` | HIGH | 2026-05-21 SBOM/vuln-scan regression Wave-1 Scout A | `_post_process_pipeline` invokes `unpack_firmware_job` for generic-archive uploads (non-Android non-tarball) | ~140 LOC / 1 commit | Scout A's primary suspect for operator-visible "sparse SBOM" symptom. Without this, generic-ZIP uploads land at `zip_contents/` without binwalk/unblob extraction — SBOM strategies find sparse results. Partial mitigation already shipped via Fix #3 walker un-gating (Session 1), but the underlying upload pipeline gap remains. |
| `sbom-regr-session2:Fix-11` | HIGH | 2026-05-21 SBOM/vuln-scan regression Wave-1 Scout E | Walker `*_walk_status` orphan reaper sweep — refactor `main.py` lifespan to derive reaper list from `walker_registry.WALKER_AUTO_TRIGGERS` so future walkers inherit coverage | ~220 LOC / 1 commit | Closes the remaining 22+ walker status columns Scout E enumerated. Fix #5 (bare_metal_audit) handled the one with a live stuck row; this generalises to ALL walkers. Architectural refactor — single commit per W2-γ. |
| `sbom-regr-session2:create-task-sweep` | MEDIUM | 2026-05-21 Fix #8 Rule #47 enumeration | Apply `_spawn_background_task` GC guard to 4 other bare `asyncio.create_task` router sites: hardware_firmware.py:654, hardware_firmware.py:750, fuzzing.py:143, emulation.py:165 | ~80 LOC total (factor helper into shared `app/utils/background.py` first) | Each site has the same GC-vanish risk Fix #8 closed for vuln-scan. Factor the helper into `app/utils/background.py` so the routers import once; then 4 per-piece commits (or 1 atomic per Rule #25 single-slice exception #2 if alignment test enforces presence). |
<!-- SHIPPED 2026-05-19 — see Completed section: RvwA-A5+B6, RvwC-C10, RvwC-C4, RvwC-C11 -->
<!-- Frontend hover panel for RvwC-C4 deferred to future UI session. -->
| `evening:RvwC-C4-frontend` | LOW | evening 2026-05-18 → P3.x | Frontend hover panel for advisory_id glossary (calls `describe_advisory` MCP tool) | ~40 LOC frontend | Backend MCP tool shipped 2026-05-19 (`f1669c3`); frontend UI hover panel deferred. |

## 3. Open — MEDIUM severity

### 3.0 Rate-limit campaign deferred items (2026-05-18)

These are explicit punts from the rate-limit Citadel review (commits
`f6dbc7b..b24a4d8` + Rule #51 promotion `4616501`). Each was identified
by one of the 5 expert-persona scouts but scoped OUT of the
shipping batch to limit blast radius. Documented rationale in commit
chain + Rule #51 worked-example evidence.

| ID | Severity | Source | Item | Effort | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| `ratelimit-2026-05-18:scout1-xff` | MEDIUM | scout1-security | X-Forwarded-For extraction in `rate_limit.py` `get_remote_address` callback | ~30 LOC + tests | Per-IP keying via slowapi default `get_remote_address` reads the immediate-peer IP. Behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (nginx / ALB / Cloudflare), all clients collapse to the proxy IP. Add `X-Forwarded-For`-aware callback gated by a `TRUST_FORWARDED_FOR` config flag (default `False`; operator opts in when deploying behind a trusted proxy). Out of scope for the f6dbc7b campaign because it's a DEPLOYMENT-shape change, not a same-deployment fix. |
<!-- SHIPPED 2026-05-19:3677f1c — see Completed section. -->
<!-- Remaining 58 unlimited endpoints from scout1's 68-endpoint audit are deferred to future rate-limit sessions. -->
| `ratelimit-2026-05-19:scout1-remaining-58` | LOW | scout1-security audit → P3.x | Sweep remaining ~58 unlimited POST endpoints from scout1's 2026-05-18 audit | scope TBD | Lower priority than the first 9 (apk_scan + comparison + attack_surface). Endpoints to audit: SBOM uploads, finding mutations, project CRUD, etc. — most are operator-CRUD shapes that don't need TIER_A_HEAVY (CRUD = TIER_C_DEFAULT 100/minute or unrestricted). Re-grep needed before scoping. |
| `ratelimit-2026-05-18:scout2-cleanup-task` | MEDIUM | scout1-security | Emulation container cleanup background task (GC containers older than `emulation_timeout_minutes`) | ~80 LOC + test | TIER_B_DOCKER 20/hour bounds spawn rate but doesn't reap zombies. Operator runs 20 emulation sessions and forgets to stop → containers accumulate over days. Add an arq cron-style task to delete containers older than the configured timeout. Out of scope for this campaign (separate feature, not 429 UX). |
| `ratelimit-2026-05-18:scout2-prometheus` | MEDIUM | scout2-infra + scout5-obs | Custom Prometheus metrics for rate-limit hits + background-task queue depth | ~50 LOC | The `event_type=rate_limit_exceeded` structured log (commit 616e89d) covers operator log-shipper greppability. A Prometheus counter `rate_limit_exceeded_total{endpoint, tier}` + gauge `vuln_scan_tasks_active` would enable dashboards. Out of scope: the existing prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator gives request-count + status-code metrics today; rate-limit hits show up as 429 there. Dedicated counters wait for Prometheus integration becoming first-class. |
| `ratelimit-2026-05-18:scout3-useratelimitedmutation` | MEDIUM | scout3-frontend-ux | Refactor pages to `useRateLimitedMutation` hook with Retry-After countdown + button disable | ~150 LOC | The C2 axios interceptor (commit ca5a64f) sets a module-scope `_rateLimitedUntilMs` + exports `isRateLimited()` / `rateLimitRemainingMs()`. A reusable hook would: (a) wrap the POST, (b) read the cooldown timestamp, (c) disable the button + show "Try again in Ns" countdown, (d) auto-re-enable when cooldown clears. Refactoring 5 pages (SbomPage / SecurityScanPage / HardwareFirmwarePage / EmulationPage / FuzzingPage). Out of scope: works correctly with the existing pages via the axios global toast; the hook is polish. |
| `ratelimit-2026-05-18:scout5-rate-limit-endpoint` | LOW | scout5-obs | `/api/v1/rate-limit-status` GET endpoint returning per-IP remaining budget per tier | ~40 LOC + frontend integration | Lets the frontend pro-actively show "X/30 scans left this hour" instead of waiting for the 429 round-trip. Cute UX win, low priority — operators rarely run multi-scan sequences that benefit from foreknowledge. |

### 3.a Refactor / documentation hygiene

| ID | Severity | Source | Item | Effort | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| `evening:RvwA-A1` | MEDIUM | evening | Promote `caplog_at` to `backend/tests/conftest.py` | ~15 LOC + remove duplicates | Duplicated across `test_hardware_firmware_cve_matcher.py` and `test_forensic10_alignment.py`. First-class pytest discovery via conftest. |
| `evening:RvwA-A2` | MEDIUM | evening | Export `_BT_NARROWING_CONDITIONS` from `patterns_loader` | ~10 LOC + replace inspect.getsource grep | Replaces `test_forensic10_alignment.py`'s `inspect.getsource(_parse_banner_cve_pin)` source-text-grep with `len(_BT_NARROWING_CONDITIONS) == 6` against an explicit constant. Mirrors the L1 `_KNOWN_FIRMWARE_NARROWING_FIELDS` shape. |
| `evening:RvwC-C8` | MEDIUM | evening | HARD-REJECT `version_regex` semantics docs | ~30 LOC | `docs/features/extending-firmware-patterns.md` lacks the field reference; add a row documenting hard-reject behaviour per `cve_matcher.py:480-491`. Supports adoption of the forward-prepared-CVE-pin recipe. |
| `evening:RvwC-C9` | MEDIUM | evening | NVD CPE refresh cadence recipe | ~30 LOC | Codify quarterly NVD-CPE audit cron for `version_regex` pins (analog of Rule #37 anchor-refresh cron). |
| `afternoon:RvwC-MED-clar` | MEDIUM | afternoon | F-FORENSIC-10 WARN message clarity | ~20 LOC clarity | Restructure the WARN to lead with the affected entry + a scannable bullet list of fix options. Operators currently scan a single-line message. |
| `afternoon:RvwC-MED-ceremonial-note` | MEDIUM | afternoon | CLAUDE.md note on ceremonial vs genuine narrowing | ~60 LOC documentation | Explain WHEN ceremonial `category_regex: ^<existing>$` is acceptable (gate-satisfying placeholder) vs WHEN genuine NVD-derived narrowing is required. Reference the 14 entries deferred for per-CVE NVD derivation. |
| `prior-2026-05-18:RvwC-CC-5` | MEDIUM | morning (carry) | Docs refresh — `docs/features/extending-firmware-patterns.md` Surface 6 + 6-surface table | ~40 LOC | Originally Reviewer C CC-5 in `postmortem-hw-firmware-adaptive-session-2026-05-18.md` (prior-adaptive session); carried via morning's `## Recommendations Carried Forward`. Re-aligns operator docs with the post-`list_extension_points` reality. |
| `morning:Rule-#28-watch` | MEDIUM | morning | `patterns_loader.py` Rule #28 watch — re-measure before next refactor | ~1 hr re-measure + scope decision | Was 1437 LOC pre-morning; ~1440 LOC post-`register_loader()` additions. Per Rule #28 intakes drift +14-22% — re-measure before scoping a refactor. Next growth: extract Realtek block per Rule #27 N+1. |

### 3.b Adaptability + content-evidence extension

| ID | Severity | Source | Item | Effort | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| `morning+afternoon:RvwC-C5` | MEDIUM | morning, afternoon | Tegra SOC token externalization to YAML | ~80 LOC + new YAML + hot-reload tests | `_TEGRA_ELF_SECTION_TOKENS` / `_TEGRA_SOC_TOKENS` / `_SOC_TO_CHIPSET` / `_TEGRA_FDT_MODEL_TOKENS` move from in-tree Python tuples to a hot-reloadable `tegra_soc_tokens.yaml` (mirror `bt_qca_codenames.yaml` shape). Closes the "operator adds 5th Tegra SoC" path. |
| `morning+afternoon:Tegra-TBDs` | MEDIUM | morning, afternoon | NVIDIA wrapper magic + BUP container magic — Tegra parser deferred TBDs | ~30 LOC × 2 + tests | When a live BSP install is available, `xxd | head` known `mb1.bin` / `tos.img` / `.bup` files to pin the bytes. Currently handled via 5th-fallback path-context gate; pinned magic would surface the subsets explicitly in `metadata["tegra_blob"]["subset"]`. |
| `morning:RvwB-B4 (2026-05-15)` | MEDIUM | morning | `_stringify_metadata` one-level-deep limitation | ~30 LOC | Current implementation walks `blob.metadata` values one level. Nested dicts (e.g. `tegra_blob.l4t_release`) are invisible. Either (a) flatten to top-level or (b) extend `_stringify_metadata` to walk one level deeper. Documented in the YAML Forward-Prepared Note + recommended fix path (a) — top-level promotion. |
| `evening:RvwB-B5` | MEDIUM | evening | `wcn7xxx` chipset_regex extension for FragAttacks | ~10 LOC YAML + 1 test | Wi-Fi 7 Qualcomm parts may carry FragAttacks-affected SoftMAC firmware. Currently the qualcomm FragAttacks advisory entry matches wcn3xxx/6xxx; extending to wcn7xxx is a per-NVD-CPE refresh task. |
| `evening:RvwA-A7 + RvwB-B9` | LOW+MEDIUM | evening | Tier 4 SBOM NVD-CPE alignment audit | ~20 LOC docs | Tier 4 emits CVE-2020-2458x on kernel_module blobs via `linux_kernel` CPE — correct per NVD scope but should be documented to avoid future "looks like FragAttacks over-attribution" confusion. |
| `afternoon:RvwB-MED-52160` | MEDIUM | afternoon | wpa_supplicant CVE-2023-52160 over-broad category | ~10 LOC YAML | NVD CPE attribution is to `w1.fi:wpa_supplicant` binary, not all WiFi. Recommend `category: wpa_supplicant` (new category) OR path_regex narrowing. |
| `afternoon:RvwC-MED-l4t-tolerance` | MEDIUM | afternoon | L4T regex tolerance for stripped formats | ~30 LOC | Current regex requires literal `(release)` token. Some operator-stripped formats omit it. Add fallback regex matching bare `R\d{2,3}\.\d+\.\d+` patterns + document the contract in the parser docstring. |
| `evening:RvwB-B11` | MEDIUM | evening | Audit KRACK / Dragonblood / BroadPwn for FragAttacks-shape over-attribution | ~1-2 hr per disclosure + NVD WebFetch | Similar SPEC-level disclosure-batch CVEs may have zero-vendor-CPE patterns that the curated tier over-attributes. Each disclosure needs its own NVD CPE walk + scoping decision (advisory-only vs per-vendor narrow). |

### 3.c Infrastructure / scaffolding

| ID | Severity | Source | Item | Effort | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| `sbom-regr-2026-05-21:env-file-propagation` | MEDIUM | 2026-05-21 SBOM/vuln-scan regression session "What Broke" #1 | `docker compose restart backend worker` after `docker compose up -d --build frontend` loses API_KEY env propagation; backend crashes on `api_key is required` gate at `main.py:70`. Persists through `down + up -d --build`. | operator inspection needed (hook blocks agent .env read) | Workaround documented: pytest via `docker run --rm -e WAIRZ_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true --network=wairz_default --volume=...` (ephemeral container) works end-to-end. .env IS present + populated (file size 1557 bytes); root cause likely in compose env_file propagation order during dependent-service recreate. Lower priority because workaround is documented. |
| `prior-2026-05-18:RvwC-REC-2` | MEDIUM | morning, afternoon (carry) | Tier A archive-suffix additions — `.7z` / `.tar.zst` / `.zst` / `.deb` | ~50 LOC + Dockerfile apt deps | Originally Reviewer C REC-2 in prior-adaptive 2026-05-18 session; carried via morning + afternoon postmortems' carry-forward lists. Small extraction cases. Validates Tier A's adaptability claim. |
| `prior-2026-05-18:RvwC-CC-2` | MEDIUM | morning, afternoon (carry) | `extraction_strategy` enum | ~30 LOC + alembic migration | Originally Reviewer C CC-2 in prior-adaptive 2026-05-18 session; carried via morning + afternoon postmortems. Replace `extracted_via_shortcut: bool` with `Literal["shortcut_clean", "shortcut_recursed", "unblob"]`. Improves operator observability. |
| `prior-2026-05-18:RvwC-CC-4` | MEDIUM | morning, afternoon (carry) | `conftest.py` `loader_with_tmp_yaml` fixture helper | ~15 LOC | Originally Reviewer C CC-4 in prior-adaptive 2026-05-18 session; carried via morning + afternoon postmortems. 8-line wrapper for the `monkeypatch+cache_clear` scaffolding currently duplicated across YAML-cache tests. |
| `morning:RvwC-make_live_db-FK` | MEDIUM | morning | `make_live_db()` FK breakage on `volatility_injection_records → memory_dump_image` | ~30 LOC + canary sweep | 3 tests in `test_sbom_router.py` blocked + likely more. Find via `pytest -k Canary --tb=line` sweep. |
| `prior-2026-05-18:RvwC-RTL-3` | LOW | morning (carry) | Realtek `bt_banner_cve_pins.yaml` worked example | ~15 LOC YAML | Originally Reviewer C RTL-3 in prior-adaptive 2026-05-18 session; carried via morning postmortem. Ship a commented-out example pin under `family: realtek_bt`. Pairs with the parser's existing realtek_bt support. |
| `prior-2026-05-18:RvwC-RTL-2` | LOW | morning (carry) | `RealtekChipsetEntry.extra: dict` field | ~10 LOC schema | Originally Reviewer C RTL-2 in prior-adaptive 2026-05-18 session; carried via morning postmortem. Operator-supplied freeform metadata pass-through. |
| `afternoon:RvwC-LOW-taint-llm` | LOW | afternoon | `state_snapshot()` adoption: taint_llm YAML loaders | ~30 LOC | `app/ai/tools/taint_llm.py:78-101` uses `@lru_cache` on YAML loaders — cold-cache shape (process-lifetime once only). Migrate to `MtimeCachedYamlLoader` for hot-reload. |
| `afternoon:RvwC-LOW-debian-l4t` | LOW | afternoon | Debian ar L4T extraction post-unblob | ~30 LOC | When unblob unpacks a `.deb` containing `/etc/nv_tegra_release` (e.g. `nvidia-l4t-bootloader_32.3.1-20191209230245_arm64.deb`), the extracted text file gets `vendor=unknown` and L4T metadata is lost. Add detector-layer check + propagate to firmware-level metadata. |

## 4. Deferred (scope-bound — DO NOT ship blindly; documented rationale)

| ID | Severity | Source | Item | Rationale |
|----|---------|--------|------|-----------|
| `morning:CVE-2021-34373..34396` | (deferred) | morning | CVE-2021-34373..34396 disclosure-batch range — 24 NVIDIA Tegra CVEs | Per Pattern #1 of `postmortem-hw-firmware-mcp-tegra-2026-05-15` (recursive NVD-CPE verification): EACH CVE requires its own NVD-CPE WebFetch + per-Tegra-SoC narrowing before pinning. Disclosure-batch antipattern at the curated tier. Not a single bulk-import. Future scout-driven sessions can pick subsets (e.g. by SoC family) for verifiable shipment. |

## 5. Completed (recent shipped work — kept for audit trail)

| ID | Severity | Source | Item | Shipped in | Notes |

Multi-defect cascade attributed to: (1) `unpack.py:106 if count <= 0: return` short-circuiting walker fan-out cluster-wide since 2026-05-12 — Scout C live-DB probe was the load-bearing diagnostic; (2) `auto_bare_metal_audit_firmware_safe` unregistered in walker_registry since the 2026-05-19 bare-metal walker shipped; (3) `upload_stage` orphan reaper missing since the 2026-05-07 `847eae9` Rule #33 conversion (Scout B suspect commit #1); (4) `bare_metal_audit_status` reaper missing — TMS320 firmware `78ad638b-...` stuck `queued` for 6 days; (5) `asyncio.create_task` GC risk at routers/sbom.py:583 (Scout D #1 candidate symptom). 25 new META-CANARY tests; combined 206-test sweep PASSED at close. **Fix #5 reaper LIVE-FIRED on TMS320 firmware id `78ad638b` during Session 1 close rebuild — "Reaped 1 orphan bare_metal_audit firmware row(s) on startup" in container log (definitive runtime proof).** Postmortem at `.planning/postmortems/postmortem-sbom-vuln-scan-regression-session1-2026-05-21.md`.

| `ics-protocol-session1` | HIGH | Wave-1+Wave-2 methodology → 2026-05-20 afternoon | ICS protocol catalog Session 1 — schema + closed Literals + catalog + resolver + 1 v0 Modbus/TCP YAML + 114 tests | `2026-05-20:0dabbd6..1d0d0a9` (3 commits) | Rule #52 third worked-example surface (sibling to bare-metal MCU + file-format YAML registry). Wave-1: 5 scouts (architecture + adjacency + red-team + operator-UX + precedence).

## 6. Methodology + refresh cadence

**Walking the postmortems.** Each postmortem's `## Recommendations Carried Forward`
section is the canonical source. Items are reviewer-tagged at finding time (Reviewer
A architecture / Reviewer B forensic-domain / Reviewer C adaptability) with a severity
band; this file preserves the tag + adds session-source sigil + status.

**Adding a new item.** When a postmortem lands with a new recommendation, the
postmortem author (or the next-session opener) appends a row to the appropriate
severity section. Use the established `<session>:<reviewer-ABC-NN>` ID scheme.

**Marking complete.** When a session ships an item, move the row to section 5 with
the commit SHA(s). Keep the audit trail (do NOT delete completed rows in the immediate
3-session window — the recent history makes Rule-of-N pattern surfacing easier).

**Pruning.** Completed rows older than ~60 days can be archived to a separate
`ADAPTIVE_BACKLOG_ARCHIVE.md` if the file grows past ~500 lines. Until then, in-place
is fine and the grep stays cheap.

**Refresh cadence.** Per `evening:RvwC-C12` operator expectation, this file is the
**single source of truth** — every hw-firmware session opener should grep it BEFORE
re-reading multiple postmortems. The first action of a new session is to spot-check
this file's `## 1. In-Progress` section against the live commit log; stale rows there
mean a prior session shipped without updating, and the corrective edit goes in the
opening commit.

**Cross-references.**
- CLAUDE.md Learned Rules: source-of-truth for the discipline this backlog operationalises.
- `.mex/context/conventions.md` Verify Checklist: per-task gate derived from CLAUDE.md.
- `.mex/patterns/INDEX.md`: recipes that close common items (e.g. `add-mcp-tool.md`
  closes most of section 2's MCP-tool items in ~30 min each).
- `.planning/knowledge/*-patterns.md` + `*-antipatterns.md`: extracted patterns
  from completed work; useful when scoping a new item against historical precedent.
