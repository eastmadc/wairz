"""Walker auto-trigger bridge — tests for the Shape A fix that wires
the 22-walker registry into the new upload pipeline.

Covers:

- ``WALKER_AUTO_TRIGGERS`` registry exposes ≥20 safe-runners (current
  count is 22 — registry_hive / driver_extractor / evtx + AppCompat /
  BCD / DPAPI / EFS / ESP / ETL / LNK / MBR-VBR / MFT / prefetch /
  scheduled_task / SDB / SRUM / USN / WMI / container / journald /
  linux_persistence / systemd).
- The registry's lazy-cache helpers behave (``get_walker_auto_triggers``
  caches; ``_clear_walker_registry_cache`` drops the cache).
- The ``_fire_walker_auto_triggers`` helper iterates the registry and
  swallows exceptions (a misbehaving walker doesn't block the others).
- Rule #35b live canary: feed a real Firmware row through the helper
  + verify each walker no-ops cleanly (empty extraction tree → empty
  result → status stays ``idle`` per Rule #39 .safe semantics).
- ``_post_process_pipeline``'s generic-ZIP path sets
  ``firmware.extracted_path`` to ``zip_contents/`` after extraction
  (the bug surfaced empirically on the RedactedVendor RedactedProduct 15.57 GB
  upload — pre-fix it stayed NULL → no detection → no walkers).
