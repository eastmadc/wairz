"""File-format manifest schema — closed-grammar Pydantic Literals.

Operator-extensible YAML at
``backend/app/services/file_format_catalog/data/file_formats/<vendor>/<format>.yaml``
loaded via :class:`app.services.file_format_catalog.FormatCatalog` (which
internally uses :class:`app.utils.yaml_cache.MtimeCachedYamlLoader`) and
validated against the models in this file. Hot-reload on mtime change
(no docker restart for YAML edits).

**Hard rule (CLAUDE.md Rule #52 — schema-driven discipline; promoted
from bare-metal-MCU-specific to wairz-wide architectural principle):**
the YAML is DATA. NO ``regex`` / ``script`` / ``template`` / ``vql`` /
``lua`` / ``expression`` / ``predicate`` / ``eval`` keys EVER. Every
extensible field is either a FREE STRING (taxonomy: vendor, category,
format_id, product) or a CLOSED LITERAL (executable semantics).
Plugin references are REGISTRY NAMES looked up at snapshot construction,
never Python import paths.

Extending the grammar requires:

1. Rule #25 single-slice cross-stack alignment commit (DB CHECK ↔
   Pydantic ``Literal`` ↔ frontend ``Record`` mirror + alignment test).
2. Rule #46 META-CANARY confirming the new value lands through the gate.
3. Code review of the new ``ref`` in the resolver's registry constant.

This bound is the durable defense against the YAML becoming a programming
language (Wave-1 S2 binwalk/yara/Velociraptor CVE class). See
:file:`.planning/research/file-format-yaml-registry-wave1-synthesis-2026-05-19.md`.

Three-level hierarchy:

    FileFormatManifest         # one YAML file per format
      ├─ Detection             # how to recognise this format
      │   └─ DetectionSignal   # cost-sorted by resolver, NOT YAML order
      ├─ Dispatch              # container fan-out by partition/inner-file/magic
      ├─ Refinement            # path-context refinement (file location-based)
      ├─ Plugin                # closed-grammar pointers to in-tree plugins
      ├─ Output                # what the classifier emits when this matches
      ├─ PreUploadHint         # surface C (format_detection.detect_format)
      ├─ ExternalManifestsPolicy  # per-format-id policy for external pushes
      ├─ Deprecation           # lifecycle field
      └─ ProvenanceStub        # contributor org + attestation pointer (P3.1 unsigned)

**Adaptability surface** (user direction 2026-05-19 — repeated 3×):
operators drop a new YAML at ``data/file_formats/<vendor>/<format>.yaml``
(in-tree, ``manifest_source: core``) or ``data/file_formats.local/<format>.yaml``
(operator overlay, ``manifest_source: operator``) and the next walker
invocation picks it up. No docker restart. No code change. Taxonomy
fields (vendor, category, format_id, product) are FREE STRINGS so partners
can contribute medical / ICS / automotive formats without core merges.
Plugin pointers are registry-name strings (validated at snapshot construction),
never Python import paths.

Wave-1 contradiction resolutions are reflected here verbatim (W2-α 2026-05-19):

* Overlay semantics — explicit ``mode: new|override|extend``; default
  ``new`` rejects duplicate ``format_id`` at load (silent shadowing closed).
* ``manifest_source`` — closed 5-value Literal; tier rank ALWAYS outranks
  numeric ``precedence`` (Scout GG §SC5 dual).
* Signal evaluation — resolver cost-sorts; YAML order is docs only.
* Match semantics — single value ``evaluation_mode: "best_match"``
  (forced default) — first-match was the bug shape.
* Plugin role — explicit ``primary | refine | none`` + on_disagreement;
  ``side_effects: "none"`` (only permitted value) closes the side-channel
  ordering attack.

Cross-feature loader validators (Wave-2 β; NOT in this schema — they live
in app/services/file_format_catalog/catalog.py because they require
catalog state):

* A1: when mode=override, override-source's manifest_source rank MUST be
  >= override-target's manifest_source rank (prevents external override of
  operator's local override).
* A2: vendor_authority is DERIVED from THIS manifest's manifest_source;
  alias_of does NOT propagate vendor_authority.
* A3: REJECT catalog load if any dispatch.cases.* target has
  deprecation.status == "removed".
* A4: REJECT cross-vendor same-precedence same-magic collision unless
  manifest_source differs.
* A5: REJECT catalog load if dispatch.depth_max >= 2 AND any chained
  manifest has plugin.matcher.bind=eager AND that plugin's cost_class
  >= magic_bytes.
