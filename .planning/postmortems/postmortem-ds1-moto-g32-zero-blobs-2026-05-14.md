# Postmortem: DEVICE_A Moto-G32 hardware-firmware detected zero blobs

> Date: 2026-05-14
> Campaign: ad-hoc systematic-debugging session (no `.planning/campaigns/` file — driven from user prompt `/citadel:systematic-debugging projects/8413d661-... hardware firmware detects nothing?!`)
> Duration: ~2 hours (commit `c0c107e` → commit `bcdfb8c`)
> Outcome: completed

## Summary

User reported "hardware firmware detects nothing" for project `8413d661` (DEVICE_A Moto-G32). Systematic-debugging traced two chained bugs in the detection pipeline + ran a deep multi-persona review that surfaced a third forensic-misclassification bug + a corpus of 4 OTHER firmwares stuck in the same shape. Five Rule #25 commits shipped: detection-roots fallback, NUL-byte sanitization, security/doc hardening, Broadcom Bluetooth classifier patterns, and a `--only-broken` operator-tooling flag. End-to-end: DEVICE_A firmware went from 0 → 331 blobs detected (18 of which are now correctly classified as Broadcom Bluetooth).

## What Broke

### 1. `_find_unblob_extraction_top` couldn't reach the outermost `_extract` ancestor
- **What happened:** For Moto-G32 radio.img extracts that drill into `radio.img_extract/.../efs_item_files/nv/item_files/rfnv`, four non-`_extract` dirs sit between the `extracted_path` leaf (`rfnv/`) and the nearest `_extract` ancestor (`gzip.uncompressed_extract/`). The existing climbing approach required cur OR parent name to end in `_extract` to traverse, so it stopped at the first non-_extract pair and returned `rfnv` unchanged. The downstream deep-walk had nothing useful to walk — detection_roots ended at the RFNV leaf (458 NV item files, no firmware blobs).
- **Caught by:** Nothing automated — user noticed missing UI rows. Root cause traced via systematic-debugging Phase 1-3 (DB observation → helper-by-helper trace → repro on real path).
- **Cost:** ~30 minutes of trace + repro. The fix itself was ~15 lines of Python.
- **Fix:** Commit `c0c107e` — path-string fallback that scans path components from the per-firmware `extracted/` marker forward to find the FIRST `_extract` segment. Returns the path up to and including that segment. Activates only when the climb returned unchanged (i.e., couldn't climb at all).
- **Infrastructure created:** 2 regression tests in `test_firmware_paths.py` pinning the deep-non-_extract case + the no-marker case.

### 2. Bulk INSERT failed on NUL bytes in PE/ELF metadata
- **What happened:** After fix #1 surfaced 313 candidate blobs, the bulk INSERT into `hardware_firmware_blobs` failed with `CharacterNotInRepertoireError: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0x00`. ELF parsers (LIEF, pyelftools) extracted strings from raw binary segments in Moto bootloader.img's 12 ELF sub-extracts; some of those strings contained embedded NUL bytes. PostgreSQL TEXT/VARCHAR/JSONB reject them.
- **Caught by:** SQLAlchemy / asyncpg — the IntegrityError surfaced immediately on `await db.commit()`. NOT caught by any pre-existing test — this codepath had never seen ELF metadata before because the upstream detection-roots fix was the precondition.
- **Cost:** ~20 minutes. Root cause apparent from the error message; fix was 30 lines of sanitizer helpers.
- **Fix:** Commit `fc08450` — added `_sanitize_text(value, max_len)` (strips NULs + C0 control chars except tab/LF/CR + clips length) and `_sanitize_jsonb(value)` (recursive dict/list/scalar walk stripping NULs from JSONB string values). Applied at the bulk-insert boundary in `detector.py`.
- **Infrastructure created:** 28 unit tests in `test_hardware_firmware_detector_sanitizers.py` (22 parametrized `_sanitize_text` cases + 4 dict/list/structure `_sanitize_jsonb` cases + 2 sanity).

### 3. BTFM.bin (Broadcom Bluetooth) miscategorized as `other/qcom_mbn/qualcomm`
- **What happened:** After fixes #1 + #2 persisted 313 blobs, forensic-domain review identified zero entries in the `bluetooth` category despite Moto-G32 having a Broadcom BCM43xx Bluetooth radio. The composite BTFM.bin archive (and its 18 unblob-extracted sub-components — cmbtfw{10..13}.tlv/.ver, apbtfw10.tlv, crbtfw11.tlv, cmnv{12,13s}.bin, crnv21.bin, apnv11.bin) fell through every Broadcom YAML pattern (which only matched `bcm*.hcd` and `brcmfmac*`) and into the qcom-prefix heuristic fallthrough → wrong vendor + wrong category.
- **Caught by:** Forensic-domain expert reviewer in Phase A2 (Citadel parallel-agent review). NOT caught by any automated test — the classifier has no negative-coverage gate for "every known Bluetooth filename shape resolves to bluetooth".
- **Cost:** ~15 minutes. Pattern authoring + classifier verification on real BTFM filenames.
- **Fix:** Commit `f6bdc4e` — added 3 YAML patterns: `^btfm\.bin$` (the archive marker), `^[a-z]{2}btfw\d+\.(tlv|ver)$` (TLV firmware images), `^[a-z]{2}nv\d+s?\.bin$` (NV config blobs). Re-detect confirmed 0 → 18 Broadcom Bluetooth blobs (DEVICE_A firmware total went 313 → 331).
- **Infrastructure created:** 9 new parametrized classifier-pattern tests in `test_hardware_firmware_classifier_patterns.py` covering the BTFM archive + each sub-component shape.

### 4. Realpath-guard missing on path-string fallback
- **What happened:** Code-security review (Citadel arch-reviewer, Phase A1) flagged: the path-string fallback validated outer dir with `os.path.isdir()` which follows symlinks. A maliciously crafted firmware containing a `_extract`-suffixed SYMLINK pointing outside the firmware sandbox could escape Rule #1 sandbox discipline.
- **Caught by:** Citadel arch-reviewer Phase A1 finding F#2 MED. Not exploitable in practice (the walker uses `followlinks=False` so data exposure is bounded), but violates the established sandbox pattern.
- **Cost:** ~10 minutes.
- **Fix:** Commit `e2e300e` — realpath both ends of the proposed outer + verify the input root's realpath is an ancestor. Reject the fallback otherwise. Also inline-documented the LAST-marker selection for nested `extracted/extracted/` shapes (arch-review F#1 MED).
- **Infrastructure created:** 2 regression tests covering the realpath-rejected case + the LAST-marker selection.

### 5. Operator-facing re-detection workflow gap
- **What happened:** Corpus audit (Phase A3) found that 5 firmwares in the live wairz DB had the same broken-detection shape (orphan_ratio >= 0.95 AND blobs_detected = 0). There's no UI button or REST endpoint to trigger re-detection — operators have to fall back to a full `/unpack` cycle (rebuilds the entire extraction tree, cost ~ minutes-to-hours).
- **Caught by:** Citadel corpus-auditor Phase A3 (grep of `routers/`, `workers/`, `frontend/`).
- **Cost:** ~10 minutes. The existing `backend/scripts/backfill_detection.py` already had `--firmware-id` / `--limit` / `--dry-run`; we added `--only-broken`.
- **Fix:** Commit `bcdfb8c` — added `--only-broken` flag that filters Firmware rows by `detection_audit.orphan_ratio >= 0.95 AND detection_audit.blobs_detected = 0` JSONB conditions.
- **Infrastructure created:** None — leveraged existing script.

## What Safety Systems Caught

| System | What It Caught | Times | Impact Prevented |
|--------|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| `device_metadata.detection_audit` JSONB | `orphan_ratio=1.0 AND blobs_detected=0` shape signaled the broken state | 1 (DEVICE_A) + 4 (corpus sweep) | The audit JSONB is the diagnostic primitive that turned "user reports nothing detected" into a SQL-queryable corpus condition — without it, the only signal would be "operator notices empty UI" |
| SQLAlchemy bulk INSERT | `CharacterNotInRepertoireError: 0x00` on NUL byte | 1 | Detection-pipeline silent corruption — without the explicit DB rejection, the 313 candidates would have failed insertion silently and operator would see "0 blobs" identically to the detection-roots bug |
| Citadel arch-reviewer (Phase A1) | Realpath-guard gap + last-marker doc gap on the c0c107e fix | 2 findings | Sandbox-discipline violation (Rule #1) shipped silently AND undocumented semantics for nested-marker shapes |
| Citadel forensic-domain reviewer (Phase A2) | BTFM.bin Broadcom miscategorization across 18 sub-components | 1 finding | 18 blobs forensically marked as "other/qualcomm" — operator querying `WHERE vendor='broadcom'` would have missed them entirely |
| Citadel corpus-auditor (Phase A3) | 4 OTHER firmwares stuck in same broken state | 1 finding | Without the sweep, those 4 firmwares would stay broken until the next user complaint per-firmware |
| `_walk_for_additional_roots` `followlinks=False` | Bounded data exposure on symlink escapes | passive | A symlink-escaping detection root would have been returned, but the walker couldn't traverse INTO the symlinked dir |

## Scope Analysis

- **Planned (user prompt):** "projects/8413d661 hardware firmware detects nothing?! using deep research and deep review / thinking across all relevant expert personas using citadel on this. full plan, full execute, don't wait for me."
- **Built:**
  - 5 Rule #25 commits across 4 files (firmware_paths.py, detector.py, firmware_patterns.yaml, backfill_detection.py + 3 test files).
  - DEVICE_A Moto-G32 went from 0 → 331 blobs detected (18 of which are correctly classified as Broadcom Bluetooth).
  - 39 net-new tests (2 firmware_paths regression + 28 sanitizer unit + 9 classifier-pattern).
  - 4 of 5 corpus-affected firmwares recovered via the path-string fallback (DEVICE_A Moto-G32 + GS724Tv6 Netgear automatically; coredx + Q17AX got root-count improvements but no blob hits because their content isn't recognized by the classifier; PowerPack + Signia bootloader hex remained at 0 — legitimate "no firmware blobs in scope" outcomes for those formats).
- **Drift:** **NONE.** Both the user's explicit ask (debug DEVICE_A) AND the implicit ask (deep multi-persona review, full execute) were satisfied. The Phase C apply-findings work is a STRICT SUPERSET driven by the user's "don't wait for me" directive.

## Patterns

1. **Parallel multi-persona Citadel review pays for itself on systematic-debugging too.** This session's 3 reviewers (arch + forensic + corpus) each found a distinct class of follow-up issue — a code-security gap (realpath-guard), a forensic-misclassification gap (Broadcom Bluetooth), and an operational-tooling gap (broken-firmware sweep). None would have been caught by a single-persona review or by automated tests.

2. **Citadel systematic-debugging skill protocol scales to multi-bug cascades.** The protocol prescribes "fix the first bug, then re-verify, then continue if another bug surfaced". Here the first fix (detection-roots fallback) surfaced the second bug (NUL bytes) which then surfaced the third (Broadcom miscategorization). The "Emergency Stop after 2 failed fixes" rule wasn't hit because each fix was forward-progressing, not retrying.

3. **JSONB detection_audit is the right primitive for corpus-level operational sweeps.** A queryable JSONB column lets the operator find every firmware in a given diagnostic state via single SQL — much better than scanning logs or polling per-firmware endpoints. Future detection-pipeline fields should follow the same pattern.

4. **Single-file detection bugs have multi-firmware corpus impact.** Five firmwares total were stuck on the SAME bug. A "fix one, audit corpus, fix the rest" workflow is the right discipline; without the corpus sweep, the 4 OTHER firmwares would stay broken indefinitely.

5. **Forensic-domain review catches what code-review can't.** The Broadcom Bluetooth miscategorization was structurally correct code — every blob got a vendor/category assignment via the classifier's fallback heuristic. Only a human DFIR analyst would notice that "0 bluetooth blobs on a phone with a Broadcom BCM4361" is forensically implausible.

## Recommendations

1. **Add an automated corpus-sweep alert** — a periodic check that COUNT(*) of firmwares with `orphan_ratio >= 0.95 AND blobs_detected = 0` is below some threshold (currently 4 post-sweep). If a future detection bug stacks up another N firmwares in this state, operator gets notified BEFORE waiting for the next user complaint.

2. **Auto-invalidate cached detection_roots on backend startup when the detector's git-SHA changes.** Add a `detector_version` stamp to `detection_audit` (corpus-auditor recommendation #4). Stale-version detection caches auto-invalidate on next backend boot.

3. **Run `backfill_detection.py --only-broken` as part of every backend Docker rebuild.** Wire into `docker compose up -d --build backend worker migrator` via a one-shot post-startup job. Cost: 1-N seconds per stuck firmware × N stuck firmwares — bounded.

4. **Expose `re-detect` as a public REST endpoint.** Operator currently has to shell into the backend container to run the backfill script. A `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/firmware/{id}/re-detect` would surface this in the UI as a button.

5. **Extend the forensic-completeness checklist** — the forensic reviewer's #4 finding lists 4 categories (bootloader, kernel, tee, ramdisk-firmware) that are systemically missing from wairz detections. These need parser/walker work beyond the scope of this debugging session — track as separate work items.

## Corpus Verification Pass (post-fix, same-session)

After the 5 fixes shipped, user pointed at project `c3cc1194-ae30-4129-97ef-9b95c785d825` (Moto-G30 XT2129-1) — same vendor / similar shape / suspected same symptom. Verification:

- **Initial state:** 441 detection_roots ALREADY widely populated (so commit `c0c107e` path-string-fallback fix wasn't the blocker for this firmware — its detection_roots were already correct at upload time). BUT `detection_audit` JSONB was NULL, indicating the detector NEVER COMPLETED. Hypothesis: hit the NUL-byte bug, was silently swallowed by the outer try/except in `_run_hardware_firmware_detection_safe`, no audit was stamped.
- **Recovery:** ran `backfill_detection.py --firmware-id f84544a9-f829-47d1-8518-d9212abc7ea8` with the post-fix backend. Result: 0 → **286 blobs persisted + 45 CVE matches** + audit stamped.
- **Blob breakdown:** 238 other/qcom_mbn/qualcomm + 15 bluetooth/broadcom (the BTFM patterns from `f6bdc4e` correctly fired) + 12 modem MBN + 11 audio MBN + 8 DSP MBN + 1 GPU ELF + 1 DTBO. Same shape as DEVICE_A with slightly fewer entries (different ROM build).
- **Unblob extraction health audit** (per CLAUDE.md Rule #34):
  - DEVICE_A Moto-G32: 9,183 files / 0 zero-byte / 0 hardlinks / 83.9 GB — HEALTHY.
  - Moto-G30: 23,053 files / 1,627 zero-byte (7.1%) / 0 hardlinks / 135.9 GB — HEALTHY. The 1,617 of 1,627 zero-byte files are kernel CONFIG_* feature-flag headers in `boot.img_extract/4096-14699654.gzip_extract/include/config/*.h` (`support.h`, `fs.h`, `device.h`, etc.). Linux kernel build artifact, not extraction corruption. Per Rule #34, the failure signature requires "zero-byte set dominated by binaries/libraries" — G30 fails that criterion (zeros are headers).
- **Cross-confirms the bug taxonomy:** DEVICE_A needed BOTH fix #1 (detection-roots fallback) AND fix #2 (NUL sanitization); G30 only needed fix #2. Both fixes were the right call — `fc08450` alone wouldn't have fixed DEVICE_A, and `c0c107e` alone wouldn't have fixed G30. The bugs were chained on DEVICE_A but independent across the corpus.
