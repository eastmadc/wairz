"""User-mode QEMU workflow: binfmt_misc + chroot shell + standalone binaries.

Extracted from ``emulation_service.py`` as step 5/7 of the Phase 5 split.

User-mode QEMU runs a single foreign-arch binary directly on the host
kernel's userspace, using the ``qemu-<arch>-static`` translator. Two
flavours are supported:

- **Firmware rootfs mode**: chroot into ``/firmware`` so every path
  resolves naturally (e.g. ``/bin/sh`` → ``/firmware/bin/sh``). The
  qemu-static binary is copied into the chroot so the kernel's
  binfmt_misc registration can execve it.
- **Standalone binary mode**: the user uploaded a lone ELF; QEMU runs
  directly with ``-L <sysroot>`` for library resolution (dynamic) or
  without (static), and no chroot.

Public surface:

- ``ensure_binfmt_misc`` — privileged short-lived container that
  registers the kernel's binfmt_misc entry for a target arch (idempotent,
  flag-file cached).
- ``setup_user_mode_container`` — post-container-create setup: copy
  qemu-static into the firmware rootfs, set up chroot /proc and /dev
  mounts, OR for standalone binaries, write marker files and chmod.
- ``build_user_shell_cmd`` — return the container-exec command list for
  an interactive QEMU user-mode shell (chroot variant or direct-QEMU
  variant).

    """Register binfmt_misc for the target architecture if not already present.

    Uses a short-lived privileged Docker container to register the QEMU
    user-mode interpreter with the kernel's binfmt_misc subsystem. The
    ``F`` (fix binary) flag causes the kernel to cache the interpreter's
    file descriptor at registration time, so it works transparently inside
    chroots and containers — any execve() of a foreign-arch ELF is handled
    by the kernel without the binary needing to be accessible from the
    process's mount namespace.

    Docker containers see an empty ``/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc`` by default
    (it's not the host's mount), so the privileged container must first
    ``mount -t binfmt_misc`` to access the real kernel entries.

    This is a host-level operation (binfmt_misc is kernel-wide) and
    persists until the host reboots or the entry is explicitly removed.
    A flag file in ``/tmp`` avoids re-running the privileged container
    on every emulation start within the same backend container lifetime.

    Failures are logged as warnings but never raised — user-mode
    emulation still works for the initial shell; only child processes
    would fail with "Exec format error".
