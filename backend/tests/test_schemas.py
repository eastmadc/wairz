"""ORM ↔ Pydantic response-schema alignment tests.

Background: CLAUDE.md learned rule #4 — every Pydantic response schema
must match its ORM model's column set. Mismatches cause silent 500s
when `from_attributes=True` serialisation hits a field the ORM doesn't
have, or when a non-nullable DB column surfaces as NULL in a `str` field.

Historical regressions:
- D1 drift (findings.source): ORM said non-null, migration said null,
  Pydantic said `str`. Fixed in alembic bb4acf97d9dd.
- D2 drift (FirmwareDetailResponse): ORM had `extraction_dir` and
  `device_metadata`, response schema only declared `device_metadata`.
  Fixed by adding `extraction_dir` to the response schema.

These tests lock in the contract: a schema may be a SUBSET of the ORM
(not every column needs to be exposed on the API) but must not INVENT
fields that don't exist on the ORM, and must cover the well-known
"must expose" set for each model.
