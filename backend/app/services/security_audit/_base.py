# Bumped 50 → 500 on 2026-05-22 (over-constraint sweep). Original 50-cap was
# silently truncating security audit results on real-world firmware:
# RedactedVendor RedactedProduct-class images surface hundreds of insecure permissions
# / dozens of hardcoded credentials / many network misconfigs, all
# legitimately distinct findings. The 50-cap dropped findings 51-N with no
# `... +N more` notice and no operator override, masking systemic
# insecurity. 500 covers the vast majority of legitimate workflows; any
# firmware with >500 findings per check is "remediate holistically"
# territory where the operator's response doesn't depend on seeing
# items 501-N individually. Follow-up: add a +N-more sentinel at every
# call site (~25 edit sites across credentials/network/permissions/
# external_scanners) — deferred per Rule #25 single-slice discipline.
