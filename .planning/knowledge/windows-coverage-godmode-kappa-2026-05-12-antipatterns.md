# Phase κ — antipatterns + failure mode audit

## Recurrence audit — existing antipatterns

| Antipattern | Source | κ recurrence count | Status post-κ |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 (CI claim mismatch — trust gh, not brief) | ι.C/D incidents | **0** | Mitigation durable — Pattern P7 catches every claim before it propagates |
| A4 (sub-agent self-reported wall vs orchestrator wall) | various | 1 minor (κ.B postmortem) | Mitigation durable — orchestrator wall trusted; sub-agent wall caveated |
| A7 (ruff without --no-cache + scoped path) | ι.C/D recurrence | **0** | Mitigation durable — all 5 κ sub-agent prompts included A7 discipline |
| A8 (missing post-migration alembic verification) | ι.C-D | **0** | Mitigation durable — all 5 κ sub-agent prompts included A8 discipline |
| Rule #23 cross-stream sweeps (worktree-isolation) | wave-1/2 incidents | **0** | Mitigation durable — all 5 streams used worktree |
| Rule #25 bundled commits (anti-pattern) | various | **0** | Mitigation durable — all 21 stream commits per-piece per Rule #25 |

**Net: ZERO antipattern recurrences in κ.** Discipline matured to durable shape.

## NEW antipatterns surfaced in κ

### A9 (NEW — Rule-of-Two): Walker test-fixture string-pattern mismatches

**Family:** sub-agents writing walker test-fixture data + matcher patterns
trip on string-escape and regex-boundary semantics that look obvious but
trigger one-line dev fixes.

**Two instances within κ:**
1. **κ.B (Windows-path raw-string escapes).** `_PATH_SUSPICIOUS_FRAGMENTS = (r"\\Users\\Public\\", ...)`
   failed parse because Python raw-string literals CAN'T end in a trailing
   backslash (`r"...\"` is a syntax error: "EOL while scanning string
   literal"). Fixed by `("\\Users\\Public\\", ...)` with explicit escaped
   backslashes (single-backslash boundaries). **Also κ.B.D migration docstring**
   `\Users` triggered "invalid escape sequence" in non-raw string; fixed with
   `r"""..."""` prefix.
2. **κ.C (cron `\b` word-boundary at `/`).** Cron temp-path matcher regex
   used `\b/tmp/` — `\b` is anchored at `\w` ↔ `\W` transitions which has
   subtle semantics around `/` and shell-special chars. Fixed by replacing
   `\b` with explicit boundary character group `(^|\\s|;|\\||&)`.

**Mitigation (codified for sub-agent prompts from κ.D onwards):**
- For Windows-path constants: prefer EXPLICIT `"\\path\\"` (escaped) over `r"\path\"` (raw with trailing backslash — syntax error)
- For shell-command / filesystem-path matchers: prefer EXPLICIT shell-boundary groups (`(^|\s|;|\||&)`) over implicit word-boundary `\b`

**Status:** Rule-of-Two; watching λ + κ.X for Rule-of-Three. κ.D + κ.E did NOT
hit this family (DPAPI was UTF-16LE GUID patterns; UsnJrnl was bitmask
constants — different families). Rule-of-Three not yet earned.

### A10 (NEW — Rule-of-One — gate-canary partner): Tokenize-based forbidden-token scanner whitespace-join gap

**Surface:** Rule #36 EXTENSION test gates that tokenize the walker source and
search for forbidden tokens via regex MUST be whitespace-tolerant because
`tokenize` joins tokens with single spaces. A naive regex `\.decrypt\(` fails
against the synthetic `obj . decrypt (` produced by `tokenize` + space-join.

**Mitigation (codified as Rule #45 + Rule #46 partner):**
- All forbidden-token regexes use `\s*` between syntactic elements: `\.\s*decrypt\s*\(`, not `\.decrypt\(`
- Synthetic-violation canary test in the same file confirms gate would catch a real violation
- Synthetic must be CONSTRUCTED CODE (concatenated lines), NOT an f-string (f-strings become string literals that tokenize strips out)

**Status:** caught in κ.D. ι.D EFS gate had same weakness; backfilled this
campaign. CODIFIED as Rule #46 (canary discipline).

### A11 (NEW — Rule-of-One): Pipe-induced silent-exit in canary instrumentation

**Surface:** Rule #24 mandatory tsc canary invoked with pipe (`tsc 2>&1 | tail
-10`) — the pipe hid the real tsc exit code (Rule #35a). The canary's failure
mode caught itself.

**Mitigation (already established as Rule #35a — reinforced by κ.E):**
- For canary invocations, NEVER use pipes when exit code matters
- Pattern: `cmd; ec=$?` (capture exit BEFORE pipe), OR `set -o pipefail` explicitly, OR `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`

**Status:** Single instance in κ.E. Caught immediately by the canary discipline.
Rule #35a + Rule #46 are durable partners.

### A12 (NEW — Rule-of-One, POST-CAMPAIGN-CLOSE FINDING): Sub-agent smoke gap on service-module imports — finding_service `from datetime import datetime` missing for ~3 hours

**Surface:** Backend container entered a 53-restart loop ~3 hours after κ.B.D
shipped (commit `a8496f7`). Root cause: κ.B.D's `_appcompat_evidence_lines`
helper introduced `last_modified_ts: datetime | None` parameter typing in
`backend/app/services/finding_service.py:3970` without adding `from datetime
import datetime` at module top. κ.D + κ.E inherited the same pattern in their
emit helpers (7 total `datetime | None` references at lines 3970, 3995, 4118,
4188, 4225, 4421, 4457).

In Python without `from __future__ import annotations`, function-SIGNATURE
type annotations are evaluated at function-definition time = module-load
time. So importing `finding_service` raised `NameError: name 'datetime' is
not defined` immediately — but only when something imported `finding_service`.
The startup chain `routers/apk_scan.py → ai/__init__.py → ai/tools/reporting.py
→ services/finding_service.py` hit the bug at backend uvicorn startup.

**Why caught LATE (3-hour gap between κ.B.D ship and user-observed 502):**
- Sub-agent smoke tests imported the WALKER module + MCP tools cleanly (those
  imports don't transitively pull `finding_service`).
- `test_finding_source_alignment.py` tests verify pairwise enum agreement
  (DB CHECK ↔ schemas Literal ↔ frontend types ↔ FINDING_SOURCE_CONFIG) and
  import `app.schemas.finding` ONLY — never `app.services.finding_service`.
- Orchestrator-side Pattern P7 verification also didn't import
  `finding_service` (verified MCP count, alembic head, FindingSource Literal
  count, ruff, CI Lint — none load the service module).
- Backend container was NOT rebuilt mid-stream (Rule #8 deferred to κ close
  per dispatch prompt). The κ-close rebuild loaded the broken module and the
  container started restart-looping silently — operator noticed at HTTP 502.

**Mitigation (Rule #11 reinforcement for future sub-agent prompts):**
When a stream's .D commit ADDS a function/method to `app/services/finding_service.py`
(or any other service module that backend imports eagerly at startup), the
sub-agent prompt MUST include a smoke import step:

```python
( cd backend && uv run python -c "
from app.services.finding_service import FindingService
fs_methods = sorted(k for k in FindingService.__dict__ if k.startswith('emit_'))
print('FindingService emit_* methods:', fs_methods)
assert 'emit_<new>_findings_from_walk' in fs_methods, 'new emit method missing'
" )
```

And the orchestrator-side Pattern P7 verification MUST include a backend
container health probe (`docker compose ps backend; docker inspect
wairz-backend-1 --format '{{.RestartCount}}'`) IF the stream's .D modified
`finding_service.py` OR any service that backend imports eagerly at startup.

**Codified into CLAUDE.md Rule #11 (post-split runtime smoke) — extension:**
the smoke applies not only to FILE SPLITS but also to FUNCTION ADDITIONS to
existing eagerly-imported service modules. A passing `pytest <specific-tests>`
is INSUFFICIENT — the smoke must explicitly import the module that was
modified.

**Fix:** added `from datetime import datetime` to `finding_service.py` top
imports (commit `b284ba8`); applied via `docker cp` + `docker compose
restart backend` per Rule #20 fast-iteration. Backend confirmed healthy.

**Status:** Rule-of-One; if a similar regression surfaces in λ.α or later,
promote to Rule-of-Two formal codification.

### A13 (NEW — Rule-of-One, EXTENDS Rule #46 to shell-script gates): `grep -q -` silently broken on ugrep-aliased systems

**Surface:** Orchestrator-side until-loop watcher set up to fire when a firmware
DB row appears for the active upload monitoring use case (2026-05-12 RedactedProduct
upload test post-κ):

```bash
until docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U wairz -d wairz -tAc \
    "SELECT id FROM firmware WHERE project_id = '<pid>'" 2>/dev/null \
    | grep -q -; do sleep 10; done
```

The watcher NEVER FIRED despite the firmware row appearing in the DB ~minutes
after the row's INSERT. Operator waited 10+ minutes before pinging.

**Root cause:** on this system `grep` is aliased to `ugrep` (per system shell
config). ugrep does NOT accept bare `-` as a "match anything" pattern — it
emits `ugrep: no PATTERN specified: specify --match or an empty "" pattern to
match all input` and exits NON-ZERO. The `until` loop reads "until command
exits 0" — with ugrep always exiting non-zero, the loop ran forever (until
hitting the 600s timeout) silently.

**This is a Rule #46 violation by the orchestrator.** I (the orchestrator)
introduced a verification mechanism (the until-loop watcher) that asserts
ABSENCE of a row → presence of a row, without canary-verifying the gate
actually fires on a synthetic positive. The first 2 watchers I dispatched
in this incident had the same bug; both silently never fired.

**Mitigation (codified for future shell-script gates):**
1. NEVER use `grep -q -` as "is there any output" — use `grep -q .` (match
   any character) OR `grep -q ""` (empty pattern matches all input on standard
   grep; check ugrep docs for the equivalent — `ugrep --empty` or `--match` flag).
2. Better: use `[ -n "$(cmd)" ]` for "is the output non-empty" — POSIX-portable,
   no grep dependency, works regardless of which `grep` impl is installed.
3. **Rule #46 partner — canary the watcher.** Before trusting an until-loop,
   force-fire it once against a synthetic positive: e.g. inject a fake row,
   verify the loop exits, remove the fake row. ~10 sec discipline; saves
   10+ minutes of wasted-wait per real incident.

**Lessons for Rule #46 codification:** Rule #46 currently lists 4 instances
(Rule #17 base, Rule #24, κ.D test-gate, κ.E pipe-induced). This incident is
the FIFTH and FIRST in the ORCHESTRATOR'S shell-script polling layer (not the
sub-agent's Python). Pattern extends beyond Python test gates to ANY
absence-asserting verification mechanism the orchestrator writes — including
ad-hoc bash watchers. Rule #46 holds at Rule-of-Five; the ORCHESTRATOR-LAYER
extension is documented here as Rule-of-One within that subclass.

**Status:** Caught + recovered same-session. Watcher fixed to use
`grep -qE "^(ready|failed)$"` (real regex pattern). Recommend future watcher
prompts use `[ -n "$()" ]` form unconditionally to eliminate the ugrep risk
class entirely.

**Surface:** Rule #24 mandatory tsc canary invoked with pipe (`tsc 2>&1 | tail
-10`) — the pipe hid the real tsc exit code (Rule #35a). The canary's failure
mode caught itself.

**Mitigation (already established as Rule #35a — reinforced by κ.E):**
- For canary invocations, NEVER use pipes when exit code matters
- Pattern: `cmd; ec=$?` (capture exit BEFORE pipe), OR `set -o pipefail` explicitly, OR `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`

**Status:** Single instance in κ.E. Caught immediately by the canary discipline.
Rule #35a + Rule #46 are durable partners.

## Walker-test-gate weakness backfill action items

1. **ι.D EFS `test_walker_no_decrypt` regex** — apply κ.D's whitespace-tolerant
   pattern (`\.\s*decrypt\s*\(`). 1-line fix. Ship in κ.X or λ. STATUS: SHIPPED THIS CAMPAIGN.

## Antipatterns NOT observed in κ

- No Rule #20 class-shape rebuild issues (no class-shape changes that would
  require restart after `docker cp`)
- No Rule #26 frontend-rebuild-not-restart violations (frontend rebuild
  triggered mid-session by orchestrator)
- No Rule #2 missing-dependency commits (no new deps; all reuse)
- No Rule #6 CLI flag version regressions (no CLI tool version upgrades)
- No Rule #9 frontend `Record<Type, ...>` blank-page regressions (all
  cross-stack alignment shipped in Rule #25 single-slice commits)

## Health signal

ZERO sub-agent dispatches failed in κ. ZERO commits to main had broken state.
ZERO Pattern P7 verifications found discrepancies. ZERO cross-stream sweeps.
**Pattern P1 + P5 + P7 + Rule #23 discipline cluster is now structurally
mature for adjacency-batch campaigns.**
