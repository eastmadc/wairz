"""Orphan reaper coverage in the FastAPI lifespan startup block.

The lifespan reapers at `backend/app/main.py:120-300` flip stuck state-machine
rows from `('queued','running','detecting','extracting','analyzing')` to
`'failed'` so subsequent POSTs don't 409 forever on phantom rows after a
backend restart. Each reaper is a few SQL `UPDATE` statements gated to its
own column. The coverage matrix is partial today — Scout E (2026-05-21
investigation) found 28+ state-machine columns missing reapers; this file
holds the Rule #46 META-CANARIES for the ones we ship and is extended by
each future commit that wires a new reaper.

Per Rule #46 §gate-canary-requirement, every "asserts absence" gate has a
paired synthesize-and-assert canary proving the gate would fire on a
regression. These tests are deliberately AST-level (read `main.py` source
+ regex / AST walk) so they catch refactors that drop a reaper without
the lifespan ever needing to actually run inside the test process.

Cross-refs:
- CLAUDE.md Rule #51 .i (orphan-reaper completeness on Rule #33 conversions)
- CLAUDE.md Rule #46 (paired META-CANARY discipline)
- 2026-05-21 SBOM/vuln-scan regression investigation Fix #2 (upload_stage),
  Fix #5 (bare_metal_audit_status) — each commit adds its reaper-presence
  canary here.
