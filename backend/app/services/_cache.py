"""Canonical cache access for the ``analysis_cache`` table.

Consolidates the ten parallel inline implementations that previously
reinvented the same "fetch-or-store cached analysis result" query into a
single module. Every service, MCP tool handler, and router that caches
firmware analysis output should use these helpers rather than querying
:class:`~app.models.analysis_cache.AnalysisCache` directly.

## Semantics

- ``binary_sha256=None`` selects/stores the **firmware-wide** cache entry
  (used by ``firmware_metadata_service``, ``component_map``, etc.). In
  PostgreSQL, nulls are distinct in unique indexes, so these entries
  coexist safely with per-binary rows under the ``idx_cache_lookup``
  index.
- ``store_cached`` uses delete-then-insert, which is idempotent under
  both the unique-constraint and constraint-absent cases. Every previous
  inline implementation relied on the unique constraint for idempotency;
  the ``cwe_checker_service`` variant was missing the defensive DELETE
  and would silently accumulate duplicates if the constraint were
  dropped — this module fixes that drift.

## Transaction ownership

Every helper issues ``flush()`` only — the caller owns ``commit()``:
MCP tool handlers rely on the outer dispatch in ``mcp_server.py`` (see
CLAUDE.md rule #3); REST routers and arq workers commit themselves.

## Cron

``cleanup_older_than`` is called from
``app.workers.arq_worker.cleanup_analysis_cache`` on a daily schedule.
The retention window is ``settings.analysis_cache_retention_days``.
