"""Health + readiness probes + shallow liveness.

Three endpoints:

- ``GET /health`` — shallow liveness. 200 OK as long as the process is
  listening. No dependency checks. Used by docker-compose container
  healthcheck and external liveness probes.
- ``GET /health/deep`` — deep readiness probe. 200 when DB + Redis + Docker
  daemon + storage root are all reachable; 503 with per-component detail
  otherwise. Historic shape — predates ``/ready`` and is kept for back-compat
  with the Phase 1 verification battery and any external monitoring already
  wired to it.
- ``GET /ready`` — identical to ``/health/deep``, exposed at the canonical
  k8s-style path for future orchestrator migrations. Prefer this in new
  probes; ``/health/deep`` will eventually be a soft-deprecation alias.

All three are auth-exempt via ``app.middleware.asgi_auth._EXEMPT_HTTP_PATHS``.
``/metrics`` (added by prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator) is also auth-exempt.
