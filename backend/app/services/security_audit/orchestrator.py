"""Scanner registry + orchestrator.

Extracted from security_audit_service.py as step 7/8 of the Phase 5 split.

Exposes the public dispatch surface:

- ``SCANNERS``: ``dict[str, ScannerFn]`` registry, keyed by check name
  (derived from the canonical ``_SECURITY_CHECKS`` list-of-tuples which
  also defines execution order for ``run_security_audit``).
- ``run_scan_subset``: by-name subset dispatch for callers that only
  need part of the audit (e.g. ``assessment_service`` runs credentials
  + shadow + crypto_material).
- ``run_security_audit`` / ``run_security_audit_multi``: full-audit
  entry points that aggregate findings into a ``ScanResult``.

This module stitches together the six per-category scanner modules
(credentials, permissions, network, external_scanners) into the
registry. Hash-lookup scanners are async and dispatched separately by
callers; they are not part of SCANNERS.
