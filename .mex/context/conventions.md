# Conventions

## Naming

- **Python modules:** `snake_case.py` (`finding_service.py`, `cwe_checker_service.py`). Service files end in `_service.py`, router files named after the resource (`projects.py`, `firmware.py`).
- **Classes:** `PascalCase`. SQLAlchemy models singular (`Project`, `Firmware`, `Finding`). Pydantic schemas suffixed by role: `ProjectCreate`, `ProjectResponse`, `ProjectListResponse`, `ProjectUpdate`.
- **DB tables/columns:** plural snake_case tables (`projects`, `firmware`, `analysis_cache`), snake_case columns (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `project_id`). UUID PKs with `default=uuid.uuid4` AND `server_default=func.gen_random_uuid()` (dual default is mandatory).
- **Router endpoint functions:** suffix with `_endpoint` when they share a conceptual name with an imported service function (Learned Rule #10). E.g. `run_clamav_scan_endpoint` in router, `run_clamav_scan` in service.
- **MCP tool names:** lowercase snake_case verbs (`list_directory`, `decompile_function`, `check_known_cves`). Register via `registry.register(name=..., description=..., input_schema=..., handler=...)`.
- **Frontend files:** Pages `PascalCasePage.tsx` (e.g. `ProjectsPage.tsx`, `EmulationPage.tsx`). API clients `camelCase.ts` in `src/api/` (`projects.ts`, `apkScan.ts`, `componentMap.ts`). Stores `camelCaseStore.ts`.
- **TypeScript types:** exhaustive `Record<UnionType, Config>` maps must include every backend enum value (Learned Rule #9). Add `?? fallback` as defense in depth.

## Structure

- **Routers are thin.** Business logic lives in `app/services/<name>_service.py`. Routers import schemas from `app/schemas/`, call a service, return the Pydantic model. Never define Pydantic models inline in a router file (Learned Rule #12).
- **MCP tool handlers live under `app/ai/tools/<category>.py`.** Each category file exposes a `register_<category>_tools(registry)` function that is called from `app/ai/__init__.py::create_tool_registry`. A new category file MUST be imported + registered there, otherwise the tool is invisible.
- **ToolContext provides: `project_id`, `firmware_id`, `extracted_path`, `db` (AsyncSession), `resolve_path(path)`.** Always use `context.resolve_path()` — it calls `validate_path()` from `app/utils/sandbox.py`. Never `os.path.join(extracted_path, user_input)` directly.
- **Background work goes through arq,** not `asyncio.create_task()` detached from the request. Unpacking the initial firmware upload is the exception — it uses `asyncio.create_task()` because the endpoint returns 202 and the frontend polls.
- **Pydantic response schemas use `from_attributes=True`** (v2 replacement for `orm_mode`) when mapped directly from ORM rows.
- **Alembic migrations** auto-run on worker container start via the entrypoint `alembic upgrade head && exec arq ...`. Generate with `docker compose exec backend alembic revision --autogenerate -m "msg"`.
- **Frontend pages poll long-running operations** with `useEffect + setInterval` every 2s until status transitions. See `EmulationPage`, `FuzzingPage`, `ProjectDetailPage` for the canonical pattern.
- **Frontend API calls** go through `src/api/<resource>.ts` which wraps the single Axios instance in `src/api/client.ts`. Pages never construct Axios calls directly.

## Patterns

### MCP tool handler — `flush()`, never `commit()`

The outer MCP dispatch in `mcp_server.py` owns the transaction. Tool handlers write with `flush()` so changes are visible intra-session but roll back on exception.

```python
# Correct
async def _handle_add_finding(input: dict, context: ToolContext) -> str:
    finding = Finding(project_id=context.project_id, **input)
    context.db.add(finding)
    await context.db.flush()
    return f"Created finding {finding.id}"

# Wrong — commits break transaction ownership and bypass rollback
await context.db.commit()
```

### Async DB access — never `gather()` coroutines sharing a session

`AsyncSession` is NOT safe for concurrent coroutine access (Learned Rule #7). Sequential `await` or fresh session per task.

```python
# Correct — sequential
result_a = await service_a(db, ...)
result_b = await service_b(db, ...)

# Correct — independent sessions
async def worker(args):
    async with async_session_factory() as db:
        ...
await asyncio.gather(worker(a), worker(b))

# Wrong — shared session in gather, silent state corruption
await asyncio.gather(service_a(db, ...), service_b(db, ...))
```

### Sync filesystem I/O — offload to executor (Learned Rule #5)

Firmware may have 10K+ files; sync os.walk blocks the event loop.

```python
loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
result = await loop.run_in_executor(None, sync_scan_fn, extracted_path)
```

Use `app/utils/sandbox.py::safe_walk` when walking firmware — plain `os.walk` skips symlinks that firmware relies on (`/bin → /usr/bin`).

### New Python dependency — update `pyproject.toml` in the same commit (Learned Rule #2)

Then verify in Docker: `docker compose exec backend python -c "import <module>"`. A missing dependency only surfaces on container rebuild.

## Verify Checklist

Derived from CLAUDE.md Learned Rules (canonical source).  When a
new rule lands in CLAUDE.md, update this checklist in the same
commit (Learned Rule #21).

Before presenting any code change:

- [ ] **Sandbox:** every new file read uses `context.resolve_path()` (MCP tools) or `validate_path()` (services). No `os.path.join(extracted_path, x)` without validation. REST endpoints serving filesystem paths `realpath` BOTH sides before comparison (Learned Rule #1, extended for the hw-firmware symlink-escape test shape).
- [ ] **DB transactions:** MCP tool handlers use `context.db.flush()`, not `commit()`. No `asyncio.gather()` on coroutines sharing a session (Learned Rules #3, #7).
- [ ] **Blocking I/O:** any sync filesystem walk or CPU-bound loop inside an async handler is wrapped in `run_in_executor` (Learned Rule #5).
- [ ] **Schema/model parity:** Pydantic response schema fields match the ORM model fields exactly (Learned Rule #4). No stray or missing columns.
- [ ] **Router naming:** router functions that share a name with an imported service are suffixed `_endpoint` (Learned Rule #10).
- [ ] **MCP tool registration:** new tool category files are imported AND called in `backend/app/ai/__init__.py::create_tool_registry`.
- [ ] **Dependencies:** `pyproject.toml` updated for any new import; `docker compose exec backend python -c "import X"` passes (Learned Rule #2).
- [ ] **Rebuild parity:** after backend code change, rebuild BOTH `backend` and `worker` (`docker compose up -d --build backend worker`). Never just one (Learned Rule #8).
- [ ] **Frontend Record<> exhaustiveness:** if a backend enum/source value was added, grep `Record<{TypeName},` across `frontend/src/` and add the new key, plus `?? fallback` at lookup sites (Learned Rule #9).
- [ ] **Inline Pydantic models:** none in router files — all schemas live in `app/schemas/` (Learned Rule #12).
- [ ] **Detection roots:** filesystem walks across extracted firmware use `get_detection_roots(firmware)`, never `firmware.extracted_path` alone (Learned Rule #16). Post-relocation Android scatter containers holding raw `.img` files at top level are themselves detection roots (Learned Rule #18).
- [ ] **Silent CLI exits:** any verification step whose success criterion is "exit 0" is canaried with a known-bad input before trusted (Learned Rule #17). Especially `tsc -b` and incremental linters.
- [ ] **Android heuristics:** platform-signing detection uses the 3-tier manifest heuristic, not certificate negation (Learned Rule #13). `priv-app` paths matched as `system/priv-app` etc., not bare name (Learned Rule #14).
- [ ] **Varchar widths:** columns storing composite keys that may exceed 100 chars (JADX class names, mangled symbols, decompile cache keys) use VARCHAR(512). Migration file width matches the ORM model width — do not rely on model-only changes (Learned Rule #15).
- [ ] **File splits:** after splitting a large file, module-level constants referenced by moved methods are verified with a runtime import call, not just `py_compile` (Learned Rule #11).
- [ ] **CLI upgrades:** before swapping an external CLI major version (binwalk v2→v3 etc.), grep every flag used and verify each exists in the new `--help` (Learned Rule #6).
- [ ] **Evidence-first remediation:** before writing backfill / cleanup / migration code for "legacy rows like X", measure the condition with a SQL `COUNT(*)` or `grep` — if zero, close with a doc note, not dormant code (Learned Rule #19).
- [ ] **Docker cp iteration:** when validating a single-file change against a stale running container (no dev bind mount), `docker cp` + in-container tool + `PYTHONPATH=/app` + `-w /app` is a <30 s iteration path. Still rebuild backend+worker before trusting for the next session. **Class-shape exception:** if the diff adds/removes/renames a field on a pydantic `BaseSettings`, `@dataclass`, SQLAlchemy model, or any class cached via `@lru_cache` or module-level singleton, `docker cp` alone is insufficient — the running process holds the OLD class reference. `docker compose restart <service>` after `docker cp` (fast boot + no image change) OR full `docker compose up -d --build backend worker` rebuild. Mechanical tell: diff adds a field in a class definition → restart required (Learned Rule #20).
- [ ] **Cross-scaffold sync:** when a rule is added to or changed in CLAUDE.md's Learned Rules list, update this Verify Checklist AND any affected `.mex/patterns/*.md` in the same commit (Learned Rule #21).
- [ ] **Multi-file migration:** for N>1 find/replace tasks, (a) grep ALL call sites before designing the replacement — the full map informs whether to centralise at a store/service layer or do per-site edits, and catches intake scope miscounts; (b) typecheck after every 1-2 file edits so errors localise to the most recent change; (c) run the intake's acceptance grep at the end (`grep 'oldPattern(' → 0 hits; grep 'newPattern' → N hits`) as both completion check and miscount detector (Learned Rule #22).
- [ ] **Parallel-dispatch worktree isolation:** every Fleet-style parallel agent runs `git worktree add .worktrees/stream-{name} -b feat/stream-{name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}` and operates inside that path — NOT just `git checkout -b`. Wave-3 evidence: β proactive worktree → 0 sweeps in 4 commits; α+γ on `checkout -b` only → 4 sweeps in 14 commits, all recovered via cherry-pick + reflog. The harness `isolation: "worktree"` + `worktreePath: "ok"` sentinel is a no-op at the working-tree level. Symlink `frontend/node_modules` from main checkout into the worktree to skip the 2 GB npm-install. `.worktrees/` is in `.gitignore`. Fallbacks (declining safety): (a) `git checkout -b feat/stream-…` — accepts ~50% sweep rate; (b) aggressive top-directory file-disjointness across streams, accept attribution noise. Strict `git add <paths>` discipline alone is NOT sufficient (Learned Rule #23, refined by Wave-3). Harness rule `auto-fleet-worktree-requires-worktree-add` flags fleet/dispatch prompts that omit `git worktree add`.
- [ ] **Frontend typecheck command:** `npx tsc -b --force` ONLY — `--noEmit` exits 0 silently under the project-references tsconfig shape (Learned Rule #24). Canary `echo 'const x: number = "nope"; export default x;' > frontend/src/__canary.ts && (cd frontend && npx tsc -b --force); rm …` once per session before trusting any "0 errors" output. `.claude/harness.json:6` `typecheck.command` is now `npx tsc -b --force` (resolved by Citadel protect-files append-only exception).
- [ ] **Multi-sub-task commits:** intakes / features with ≥3 independently-verifiable sub-tasks commit each sub-task separately, not bundled — alembic chains one-per-revision, schema+service+router one-per-layer, frontend virtualisation one-per-page; Rule-8 class-shape rebuild once at end of stream (Learned Rule #25).
