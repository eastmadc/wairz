"""Helper for pagination against SQLAlchemy async sessions.

Call signature::

    items, total = await paginate_query(db, stmt, offset=0, limit=100)

For ``select(Model)`` style statements, ``items`` is the result of
``.scalars().all()``.  For composite ``select(Model, col, col)`` style
statements (e.g. vulnerabilities joined with component name/version) use
``paginate_query_rows`` which returns ``Row`` objects unchanged — the
caller owns the row-to-response shaping.

The count is built by wrapping the statement in a subquery:
``select(func.count()).select_from(stmt.subquery())``.  This works for
joins, filters, and ``order_by`` because the subquery erases the ORDER
BY cost.  We strip any ORDER BY from the count path for Postgres
efficiency — ``count()`` over an unordered subquery is cheaper.
